Keras for beginners

To get started we need to install CUDA and CUDNN if you want to use your internal GPU for running tensorflow.


## Installing Nvidia Drivers and Cuda
Firstly we need to install nvidia driver I personally recomend nvidia 396. To install that open up terminal and type:

```
sudo apt-get install nvidia-390
```

I recommended installing cuda 9.0 or 9.1 as 9.2 is not fully supported and you might run into mulitple errors when playing around with tensorflow

1. Go to Cuda tool kit and scroll down to [legacy releases](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive)
2. Download the local runfile. Make sure you select the correct operating system in this tutorial i will be using linix
3.
